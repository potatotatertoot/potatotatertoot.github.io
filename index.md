## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, Part 1 

    I enjoyed this lab because I was able to calculate the unit price of a pizza and incorporate mathematics in programming. It was interesting to see the price of a pizza per square inch and create this program to automate that.  

* Lab 8, Part 1 

    This lab was a good way for me to thoroughly understand if statements and how strings performed. I was fond of the sandwich example to use as a pattern and how there are a lot of combinations to be made. 

* Lab 9, Part 1 

    This lab was challenging at first, because of the incorporation of the arithmetic side of the lab. After brainstorming the problem, I was able to find a way to calculate the average and it felt relieving. I also found it interesting that you could use this program to calculate averages of many things.
